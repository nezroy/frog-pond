Lots of mess and leftover stuff not currently functional (like the original UI for doing pilot info mgmt).
Things I hope to do still to get this up to relevance for others:

* my NCF proto not in here yet
* process for adding CREST-tokens for chars not in here yet
* a bunch of the static assets that I typically host on cloudfront not in this repo yet
* docker image for nginx/mysql build and env
